# Rearrange Pet Tab
A WoW WotLK Classic add-on that rearranges the pet frame.

The default companion/mount interface is simply too clunky, as many collectables have the same icon,
and having to click them to find out what they are, is simply too cumbersome.

This addon removes the model display in exchange for displaying the companions and mounts in a list form.
On top of that, it also allows you to use the mouse wheel to scroll through the pages.

This addon is only tested on stock UI and ElvUI.
