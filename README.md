# Rearrange Pet Tab
A WoW WotLK Classic add-on that rearranges the pet frame.

The default companion/mount interface is simply too clunky, as many collectables have the same icon,
and having to click them to find out what they are, is simply too cumbersome.

This addon moves the model display out of the companion frame in exchange for displaying the companions
and mounts in a list form. The model display visibility may be toggled. On top of that, it also allows
you to use the mouse wheel to scroll through the pages.

This addon is only tested on stock UI and ElvUI.
